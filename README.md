# SQLtoWebAPI
Node backend providing REST API for SQL Server

I'm exposing a basic MS SQL database table via REST API for future consumtion by a basic HTML frontend as well as a SlackBot. It will eventually serve as a status update robot that requests updates from staff on current projects.

Focusing on learning NodeJS conventions of callbacks and modularity.

To do:

*Timestamp column for row updates. If a row has not been updated in n days I want the user to 
be asked for an update.

*Slack BotKit integration. The ability to update a row by talking to a bot.

*A web front end.
