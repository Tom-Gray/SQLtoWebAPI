# SQLtoWebAPI
Node backend providing REST API for SQL Server

I'm exposing a basic MS SQL database table via REST API for future consumtion by a basic HTML frontend as well as a SlackBot. It will eventually serve as a status update robot that requests updates from staff on current projects.

Focusing on learning NodeJS conventions of callbacks and modularity.
